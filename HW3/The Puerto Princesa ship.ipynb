After one or two hours, the boat loses its GPS connection because of a technical issue. Captain keeps navigating the ship to its destination, using the stars and four old radio towers, which you can see on the map. Each antenna could measure the ship's coordinates (X, Y) and send them to its receiver. There are five records of towers signals at five different times, available for you in the records.json file. Also, the boat's actual coordinates are available in the real_coordinates.json file. The exact coordinates are ONLY FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES, and you CAN NOT use them as input data. The five dots on the map below are actual coordinates of the ship, at each time step where the records from antennas were received.
